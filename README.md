# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Rover
This is a project to control the drive of a mini rover. The setup involves two major components. The primary Component is the Laptop running a python script that detects hand gestures and transmits the data over radio via a radio module hooked up with an Arduino which in turn is connected to the laptop. The second component is the Mini Rover itself which will be controlled with our hand moments. The rover is set up with an Arduino to receive the signal from the laptop via a receiver radio module & a motor driver to control 4 motors that drive the rover.
